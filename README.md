**üéØ Disclaimer:** Kotlin Encabulator is part of a balanced breakfast.

Have you been unproductive? Maybe felling like a fraud? Do you not know how to program? Well, we can't help with any of that! However, *can* do *something* for you!

## Encabulate today!
---
Introducing Kotlin Encabulator, the newest (shameless [rust-stakeholder](https://github.com/giacomo-b/rust-stakeholder/blob/master/README.md) clone), hottest, encabulating developer tool! 

Never again run out of excuses for a coffee break, or look unwise, or be seen as a slacker. Anyone who looks at your terminal from now on shall forever be impressed by the sheer amount of bullsh\*t coursing through your fancy MacBook.

> "Before using the Encabulator I was on the verge of being fired, due to the high complexity of compiling rust on Windows. Other offers such as [rust-stakeholder](https://github.com/giacomo-b/rust-stakeholder/blob/master/README.md) just didn't cut it. Now I am senior software assurance specialist!"
- Erick, vibecoder.

The Encabulator works by high-jacking one simple concept of human psychology, via the natural neutrals pathways relevant to the Stroheim response complex. 
One is capable of leveraging zeta waves to induce an aura of expertise to be projected upon the encabulatee.
That is, print a torrential downfall of eldritch error codes, logger debug information and progress bars to the terminal and hope whoever's supposed to sign on one of your paychecks believe that...
YOU, yes... YOU! Are a productive member of this enterprise! (utter delusion)
